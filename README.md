Project Description
This project is a digital musical note generator designed using the Altera MAX 2 CPLD. The system combines hardware and digital logic to create a compact and interactive musical device. It utilizes a breadboard PCB for circuit implementation, which includes 7 push buttons, 7 LEDs, and a speaker.

Each push button represents a musical note from the Indian classical music scale (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni). When a button is pressed:

1. A signal is sent to the CPLD, which processes the input in real time.
2. The CPLD lights up the corresponding LED, providing a visual indication of the note being played.
3. Simultaneously, the CPLD generates a specific sound frequency for the pressed note, which is output through the speaker.
This project demonstrates the use of programmable logic devices (CPLD) for real-time signal generation and control. It highlights the capability of digital circuits to interface with both audio and visual components, making it an excellent tool for music learning, experimentation, and showcasing CPLD applications.
